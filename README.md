## Features
<br>

- Cantilever design focused on stiffness and stability with a low center of gravity (Hopefully)
- Streamlined frame assembly consisting of only four extrusions
- Lightweight bed carriage assembly with carbon fiber components
- AWD stepper configuration for the Y-axis and X-axis
- 150 mm^2 x 150 mm maximum build volume
- Optimized for daily print speeds of 400-600 mm/s with 20.000 mm/s^2 acceleration
- Motion system capable of 1.000 mm/s speed with 100.000 mm/s^2 acceleration (I think.)
- Built using 20 series V-slotted extrusions with parts up to 4040
- Genuine high-quality motion system components ([BOM]())
- Entire motion system based on high preload MGN12H and MGN9H linear guide rails
- Mostly belt-driven with minimal belt paths
- Lightweight dual plate with integrated tensioner
- Rigid carbon fiber bed mount
- Double shear shaft supports for Y and X-axis steppers
- High torque stepper motors supplied with 48V for the X and Y-axis
- Driven by the SKR 3 board with TMC5160 drivers
- Running [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) firmware
- Toolhead based on the Lancer Long hotend and HF extender
- Protoextruder 2.0 or Protoextruder NF direct drive extruder
- Dual 5015 fan setup for part cooling
- Adopts the [Bigtreetech Eddy Probe](https://github.com/bigtreetech/Eddy)
- Minimalistic [printed part design](/STL) focused on strength and easy printability
- Printed in PETG CF, providing high temperature resistance
- Easily enclosed, with the main electronic components outside of the build chamber.
  - The 150 mm^2 bed configuration can be fully enclosed up to the frame bounding box, with no extra space needed for the bed movement.
