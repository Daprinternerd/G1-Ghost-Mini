❗ Make a folder first in Fusion360 in which to upload and open the G1 Mini.f3z file.  
This is a archive format that contains all the linked assemblies and component instances. Otherwise the upload will "explode" all the individual files into your main working folder.

>Note: The CAD file contains a set of hidden components and instructions to aid the assembly process.
